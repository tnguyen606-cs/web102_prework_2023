## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges I've faced while building the app was adding image to the *games-container* element including the attributes itself, there were no example of how to create the value of the *src* attribute of an image element using the given path in the array. Also, destructuring and the spread operator is sort of difficult to understand, the given example does not clearly explain on how each operator work with the output itself, so that I have to look for some outside resources to learn more about that. And, some secret key questions are very ambiguous to answer.
